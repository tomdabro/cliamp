# Configuration

Use the interactive wizard to configure remote providers. Supported providers are Navidrome, Lyrion, Plex, Jellyfin, Emby, Spotify, Qobuz, Tidal, Mixcloud, NetEase, Audiobookshelf, and YouTube Music:

```sh
cliamp setup
```

The wizard writes the required TOML block and leaves the rest of your config unchanged. It validates server credentials during setup when the provider supports it: Navidrome, Lyrion, Plex, Jellyfin, and Emby. OAuth providers such as Spotify, Qobuz, and Tidal sign in later in the player. Tidal uses a `link.tidal.com` device code. Mixcloud checks optional browser-session or OAuth credentials when you use them. See [cli.md](cli.md#setup-wizard) for details.

## Config directory

cliamp searches for its config directory in this order:

- `CLIAMP_CONFIG_DIR`
- `XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cliamp`
- `HOME/.config/cliamp`
- on Windows, `%APPDATA%\cliamp` when `HOME` is not set

The examples below use `~/.config/cliamp`. On Windows without `HOME`, use `%APPDATA%\cliamp` instead.

For other settings, copy and edit the example config:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/cliamp
cp config.toml.example ~/.config/cliamp/config.toml
```

## Options

```toml
# Default volume in dB (range: volume_min to 6)
volume = 0

# Minimum volume floor in dB (range: -90 to 0, default: -50)
# Controls how low the volume control can go.
volume_min = -50

# Repeat mode: "off", "all", or "one"
repeat = "off"

# Start with shuffle enabled
shuffle = false

# Start with mono output (L+R downmix)
mono = false

# Initial directory for the file browser ('o' key)
initial_directory = "~/Music"

# Shift+Left/Right seek jump in seconds
seek_large_step_sec = 30

# EQ preset: "Flat", "Rock", "Pop", "Jazz", "Classical",
#             "Bass Boost", "Treble Boost", "Vocal", "Electronic", "Acoustic"
# Leave empty or "Custom" to use manual eq values below
eq_preset = "Flat"

# 10-band EQ gains in dB (range: -12 to 12)
# Bands: 70Hz, 180Hz, 320Hz, 600Hz, 1kHz, 3kHz, 6kHz, 12kHz, 14kHz, 16kHz
# Saved Custom curve; applied when eq_preset is "Custom" or empty
eq = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

# Manual EQ changes update this curve automatically. Cycling presets with e
# keeps it available, and both values are restored after restart.

# Visualizer mode (leave empty for default Bars)
# Options: Bars, BarsDot, Rain, BarsOutline, Bricks, Columns, ClassicPeak, Wave, Scatter, Flame, Retro, Pulse, Matrix, Binary, Sakura, Firework, Bubbles, Logo, Terrain, Scope, Heartbeat, Butterfly, Ascii, Firefly, Mosaic, Sand, Geyser, ClassicLED, Stereo, Mirror, None
# Mirror draws tapered Braille bars around a persistent horizontal center axis.
visualizer = "Bars"

# Visualizer volume linking (default: true)
# When true, bar height follows the current volume level (classic behavior).
# Set to false to decouple the visualizer from volume — bars stay visible
# even at very low volume levels.
vis_volume_linked = true

# Reduce CPU usage by lowering UI cadence and disabling visualization.
# This has the same effect as starting with --low-power.
low_power = false

# Simplified mode: artist/title and time strip without a visualizer or playlist.
# No visualizer or playback controls are shown.
simplified = false

# Album cover height in terminal rows, shown beside the now-playing header on
# the full (80x24+) layout. Width is derived automatically (2x the height).
# Set to 0 to disable album art entirely. Range 3-20 (default 7).
# Toggle at runtime with Ctrl+A.
album_art_height = 7

# Album art rendering protocol:
#   "auto"   - use the Kitty graphics protocol on Kitty/Ghostty/WezTerm for a
#              crisp image, otherwise colored half-blocks (default)
#   "kitty"  - force the Kitty graphics protocol
#   "blocks" - force half-block text (works on any truecolor terminal)
album_art_protocol = "auto"

# UI theme name (see available themes in ~/.config/cliamp/themes/)
theme = "Tokyo Night"

# Log level: "debug", "info", "warn", or "error" (default "info")
# Logs are written to ~/.config/cliamp/cliamp.log
log_level = "info"

```

`Stereo` shows separate left and right horizontal LED meters with held peak markers.

## Terminal Layout

cliamp adapts its playback screen to the terminal size:

| Terminal size | Layout |
| --- | --- |
| At least `80x24` | Full controls, five visualizer rows, and detailed source controls |
| At least `56x16` | Compact controls and three visualizer rows |
| At least `40x10` | Minimal playback, list, seek bar, and help layout |
| Smaller than `40x10` | Resize message only |

`simplified = true` replaces the main playback view with the current track
artist/title, time, and seek-progress strip. It hides the visualizer, playback
controls, and playlist. Provider browsing and overlays keep their list-focused
layout. Start one session with `cliamp --simplified`.

List views such as provider browsing, file selection, queues, playlists, search
results, themes, and keybindings use a content-first layout. This layout replaces
the visualizer and detailed controls with a compact now-playing summary. It leaves
more rows for navigation. The visualizer picker keeps its live preview.

## Album Art

On the full (80x24+) layout, the currently playing track's album cover renders
beside the now-playing header, to the left of the title, artist, and time. The
spectrum visualizer stays full-width below it. Set `album_art_height` (rows;
width is derived as `2x`) or `0` to disable, and toggle at runtime with `Ctrl+A`.

Rendering uses one of two paths, chosen by `album_art_protocol`:

- **Kitty graphics** (`auto` on Kitty, Ghostty, and WezTerm, or forced with
  `kitty`) draws a real, crisp image using the terminal's graphics protocol.
- **Half-blocks** (`auto` elsewhere, or forced with `blocks`) draws the cover
  with colored `▀` characters. This works on any truecolor terminal but is
  low-resolution (one cell = one horizontal pixel, two vertical), so it looks
  pixelated at small sizes — increase `album_art_height` for more detail.

Cover art is sourced per provider: local files use embedded tags, and Spotify,
Navidrome, Plex, Jellyfin, Emby, and YouTube Music supply cover URLs from their
APIs. The same artwork is published to MPRIS / macOS Now Playing. Downloaded
covers are cached under `~/.local/share/cliamp/cover-cache/`.

## Secrets from Environment Variables

Set a string value in `config.toml` to `$VAR_NAME` or `${VAR_NAME}` to read it from an environment variable. This keeps passwords, tokens, and client secrets out of the file.

```toml
[navidrome]
url = "https://music.example.com"
user = "alice"
password = "${NAVIDROME_PASSWORD}"

[lyrion]
url = "http://nas.local:9000"
user = "alice"
password = "${LYRION_PASSWORD}"
# show_unplayable = true  # include plugin-contributed tracks and playlists

[plex]
url = "http://plex.local:32400"
token = "$PLEX_TOKEN"

[jellyfin]
url = "https://jelly.example.com"
token = "${JELLYFIN_TOKEN}"

[emby]
url = "https://emby.example.com"
token = "${EMBY_TOKEN}"

[audiobookshelf]
url = "https://abs.example.com"
token = "${AUDIOBOOKSHELF_TOKEN}"

[ytmusic]
client_id = "${YTMUSIC_CLIENT_ID}"
client_secret = "${YTMUSIC_CLIENT_SECRET}"
# Optional: resolve full playlists from list= URLs (default true). Set to false to strip playlist params.
# expand_playlist = true

[mixcloud]
access_token = "${MIXCLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN}"
```

Rules:

- Interpolation occurs only when the **entire** value is `$NAME` or `${NAME}`. cliamp keeps mixed values such as `"p@$$word"` literally. No escaping is required.
- Variable names match `[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*`.
- If the variable is unset, the value is empty (the same as if you had left it blank).
- Works for any string field, including plugin config under `[plugins.<name>]`.

## Default Provider

Set the provider that cliamp opens at start:

```toml
provider = "radio"
```

Valid values: `radio` (default), `navidrome`, `lyrion`, `spotify`, `plex`, `jellyfin`, `emby`, `qobuz`, `tidal`, `soundcloud`, `mixcloud`, `netease`, `audiobookshelf`, `yt`, `youtube`, `ytmusic`.

You can also override this setting on the CLI: `cliamp --provider jellyfin`.

## SoundCloud

SoundCloud is optional. Add this section to `~/.config/cliamp/config.toml` to register the provider:

```toml
[soundcloud]
enabled = true
```

After you enable SoundCloud, use `Ctrl+F` to search. Pasted SoundCloud URLs play through yt-dlp. The empty browse view contains search-backed genre playlists: **Trending**, **Hip-Hop**, **Electronic**, **House**, **Lo-Fi**, **Indie**, and **Pop**.

> SoundCloud official chart and discover endpoints return 404 through yt-dlp. cliamp cannot show anonymous real chart data. The genre playlists use search results. Result quality varies but reflects current uploads.

### Browse a profile

Set a username to show that profile tracks, likes, and reposts in the browse view:

```toml
[soundcloud]
enabled = true
user = "yourname"
```

Three playlists appear for `soundcloud.com/yourname`: **Tracks**, **Likes**, and **Reposts**. This works for any public profile.

### Sign in via browser cookies

SoundCloud closed its OAuth program in 2014. The bring-your-own-client_id method that Spotify uses is not available. Instead, point yt-dlp to an existing browser session. It reads your SoundCloud login from the browser cookie jar:

```toml
[soundcloud]
enabled = true
user = "yourname"
cookies_from = "firefox"   # or chrome, chromium, brave, edge, opera, safari, vivaldi
```

With cookies set, yt-dlp can stream subscriber-gated tracks (SoundCloud Go+) and access private likes and playlists that your account can access. The same cookies apply to player yt-dlp calls. Playback uses your signed-in session.

Requires `yt-dlp` on `PATH`.

## Mixcloud

Mixcloud is optional. Public recent releases, popular shows, global show browsing,
the live category catalog, Latest/Popular genre charts, genre and tag search,
native show search, direct creator jumps, and playback need no account:

```toml
[mixcloud]
enabled = true
```

Add `username` for your following stream, activity, uploads, read-only show
favorites, listening history, collections, and followed-creator browsing. An
optional developer `access_token` sets `/me/` as the account identity and adds
Listen Later. `cookies_from` gives yt-dlp your signed-in browser session for
playback that requires it.

```toml
[mixcloud]
enabled = true
username = "yourname"
access_token = "${MIXCLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN}"
cookies_from = "firefox"
styles = ["ambient", "deep-house", "jazz", "techno"]
max_items = 100
stream_creators = 20
```

The `styles` list is also the local genre-favorites list for the provider. In
the **Genres** browser, `/` filters and searches the complete tag catalog. `f`
adds or removes a style as one action and refreshes its Latest/Popular provider
rows. These favorites do not change the Mixcloud website account.

See [mixcloud.md](mixcloud.md) for the feature matrix, provider-pane inventory,
navigation and keybindings, favorite terminology, OAuth-token setup, signed-in
playback, resume, seeking, and upstream limitations.

## NetEase Cloud Music

NetEase is optional and uses an existing browser session. Sign in at `music.163.com`, then run:

```sh
cliamp setup
```

Select **NetEase Cloud Music** and the browser that you used to sign in. The menu lists common browsers. Select the custom option only for profile-specific values. The setup wizard validates the session and writes:

```toml
[netease]
enabled = true
cookies_from = "chrome"
user_id = "your-account-user-id"
```

After you enable NetEase, the provider shows liked songs, created playlists, saved playlists, and public charts. Use `Ctrl+F` to search. Playback uses `yt-dlp` with the same browser cookie source.

## Custom Radio Stations

Add stations to `~/.config/cliamp/radios.toml`:

```toml
[[station]]
name = "Jazz FM"
url = "https://jazz.example.com/stream"

[[station]]
name = "Ambient Radio"
url = "https://ambient.example.com/stream.m3u"
```

These stations appear with the built-in cliamp radio in the Radio provider.

See [audio-quality.md](audio-quality.md) for sample rate, buffer, bit depth, and resample quality settings.

## WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

cliamp uses ALSA for audio on Linux. WSL2 does not expose ALSA hardware directly. WSLg provides a PulseAudio server that ALSA can use.

If you see `ALSA lib pcm.c: Unknown PCM default`, use these two steps:

**1. Install the ALSA PulseAudio plugin:**

```sh
sudo apt install libasound2-plugins
```

**2. Create `~/.asoundrc` to route ALSA through PulseAudio:**

```sh
cat > ~/.asoundrc << 'EOF'
pcm.default pulse
ctl.default pulse
EOF
```

WSLg must be active. `echo $PULSE_SERVER` should print a path. If it is empty, use Windows 11 with WSLg enabled. Run `wsl --shutdown`, then reopen the terminal.

## ffmpeg (optional)

AAC, ALAC (`.m4a`), Opus, and WMA playback require [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/):

```sh
# Arch
sudo pacman -S ffmpeg
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install ffmpeg
# macOS
brew install ffmpeg
```

MP3, WAV, FLAC, and OGG work without ffmpeg.
