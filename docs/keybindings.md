# Keybindings

Press `Ctrl+K` in any mode, or `?` in the player, to view keybindings. The
keymap first shows commands for the active screen. It then shows player and
library commands.

## Playback

|---|---|
| `Space` | Play / Pause |
| `s` | Stop |
| `>` `.` | Next track |
| `<` `,` | Previous track |
| `Left` `Right` | Seek -/+5s |
| `Shift+Left` `Shift+Right` | Seek -/+30s (configurable) |
| `N` then `j` | Seek to N * 10% of the track (for example, `7j` jumps to 70%, `0j` to the start) |
| `+` `-` | Volume up/down |
| `]` `[` | Change speed by 0.25x |

|---|---|
| `Tab` | Cycle visible controls (Playlist / EQ / Source / Speed on full and compact layouts) |
| `j` `k` / `Up` `Down` | Playlist scroll / EQ band adjust (wraps around) |
| `PageUp` `PageDown` / `Ctrl+U` `Ctrl+D` | Scroll playlist/file browser by page (outside text input) |

playlist. This prevents accidental changes to EQ, source, and speed settings.
`Esc` still opens the separate provider-list view.

## Text Input

fields support these editor keys:

| Key | Action |

Theme and visualizer pickers support `/` filtering. While you browse, arrow

active when the picker opened. While you type a filter, `Enter` completes it
and `Esc` clears it.

### Inside the playlist manager

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `↑` `↓` / `j` `k` | Move cursor |
| `/` | Filter (incremental); `Esc` clears |
| `Enter` / `→` | List screen: open the selected playlist. Tracks screen: play the **selected** track. |
| `p` | Tracks screen: play all from the top |
| `w` | List: save the current queue with the playlist picker. Tracks: copy marked or selected tracks to another playlist. |
| `Space` | Tracks: mark/unmark highlighted track and advance |
| `[` `]` | Tracks: move highlighted track and save the playlist |
| `s` | Tracks: sort and save, cycling `track`, `title`, `artist`, `album`, `artist+album`, `path` |
| `o` | Tracks: open file browser to add files to this playlist |
| `D` | List: open the file browser to add `[[dir]]` sources to the selected playlist. Tracks: open the directory-sources screen. |
| `a` | List: create a playlist. After naming it, the file browser opens at `~`. Use `Enter` to enter a directory, `Space` to select folders or files, `Enter` to confirm, or `Esc` to finish. Tracks: mark or unmark all visible tracks. |
| `r` | List: rename the playlist (`Recently Played` cannot be renamed) |
| `d` | List: delete playlist (confirms; `Recently Played` cannot be deleted). Tracks: remove marked tracks, or highlighted track when none are marked |
| `u` | Undo the last manager edit |
| `←` `Backspace` `h` | Tracks screen: go back to the list |
| `Esc` | Close the playlist manager or go back |

Shift-letter keys switch providers. Playlist-manager track actions use lowercase
or punctuation keys. `D` is the exception. It opens the directory-sources
screen.

#### Directory sources screen (`D` from the tracks screen)

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `↑` `↓` / `j` `k` | Navigate directory sources |
| `a` | Open the file browser to add a directory as a `[[dir]]` source |
| `d` then `y` | Remove the selected source. `y` confirms; any other key cancels. |
| `r` | Toggle `recursive` on the highlighted source |
| `←` `Backspace` `h` `Esc` | Back to the tracks screen |

## File browser

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `↑` `↓` / `j` `k` | Move cursor |
| `←` `→` / `h` `l` / `Enter` | Go back; open a directory or file |
| `/` | Filter files |
| `Space` | Select or unselect file/directory |
| `a` | Select/unselect all visible audio files |
| `R` | Replace the current queue with selected files (confirm when it is non-empty) |
| `w` | Write selected files to a local playlist |
| `D` | Add selected folders as live `[[dir]]` sources to the target playlist. If none are selected, add the selected folder or the open directory. The browser stays open. |
| `~` `.` | Jump to home / current working directory |
| `Esc` `o` | Close file browser |

When the browser adds to a playlist, selected folders become `[[dir]]` sources.
Selected audio files become explicit tracks. This mode starts when you open the
browser with `D` from the manager list, with `o` from the tracks screen, or
after you create a playlist with `a`. In this mode, `Esc` means "done". cliamp
commits pending selections before it closes the browser.

## Provider browser (`N` key)

Press `N` to open a provider. These providers use the same album, artist, and
track screen keys: Navidrome, Lyrion, Plex, Jellyfin, Emby, Audiobookshelf,
Spotify, Qobuz, Tidal, Mixcloud, and YouTube Music.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `↑` `↓` / `j` `k` | Move cursor (wraps from top to bottom) |
| `←` `→` / `h` `l` | Go back; open the selected item |
| `/` | Filter the visible list. In the Mixcloud Genres list, `Enter` searches the complete server-side genre/tag catalog. |
| `f` | In the Mixcloud Genres list, favorite or unfavorite the selected genre locally. Update `[mixcloud].styles`. |
| `Enter` | Open the selected artist or album. Play the selected track and queue the rest of the visible list. |
| `R` | Replace the queue with all visible tracks (start from the top, confirm when non-empty) |
| `a` | Append all visible tracks to the queue |
| `q` | Queue the highlighted track to play next |
| `s` | Cycle album sort (album list only) |
| `S` `N` `P` `J` `E` `Y` `C` `X` `M` `Q` `T` `L` | Switch to that provider without opening the main pane. `R` replaces the queue on the track screen. |
| `Esc` `b` | Go back one level; close the browser |

The Mixcloud browser menu has **By Show**, **By Creator**, **By Creator / Show**,
and **Genres**. Genre favorites add Latest/Popular rows to the provider pane and
show-sort menu. They do not change the Mixcloud website account. The header
shows a source path such as `Navidrome / Miles Davis / Kind of Blue / Tracks`.
This keeps the current provider and open location visible. Track rows show
right-aligned durations when the provider provides them.

For Mixcloud, selecting a Show, a creator Uploads/Favorites collection, or a
genre Latest/Popular view replaces the main playlist and closes the browser. An
empty result leaves the current playlist and browser unchanged.

## Provider playlist list

The playlists pane appears when the focus is on a provider, such as Spotify,
Navidrome, or Local Playlists:

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `↑` `↓` / `j` `k` | Move cursor (wraps) |
| `Ctrl+U` `Ctrl+D` | Scroll by page |
| `Enter` | Load the selected playlist tracks into the queue |
| `/` | Filter the playlist list |
| `Ctrl+F` | Run the provider online or server search (Spotify, Navidrome, NetEase, and others). |
| `Ctrl+R` | Refresh the playlist list from the provider. For Mixcloud, also clear the cached `/me/` identity. |
| `p` | Open the playlist manager (Local pane only; create, rename, delete, add dirs/tracks) |
| `S` `N` `P` `J` `E` `Y` `C` `X` `M` `Q` `L` `R` | Switch to that provider |
| `Tab` | Switch focus to EQ |
| `Esc` `b` | Back to the playlist pane |

Playlist rows show `Name · N tracks · 1h 23m` when the provider returns track
counts and total duration. The header shows `Provider / Playlists`. The loaded
playlist has a `▶` prefix. Spotify groups playlists under section headers (`── library ──`, `── your playlists ──`, `── followed playlists ──`). For configured accounts, Mixcloud shows Your Mixcloud first: Stream, then Favorites. It then
shows Browse shortcuts, public collections, Discover charts, and a
Latest/Popular pair for each locally favorited genre under Music Styles. Leaving
a provider-pane Browse shortcut returns to the provider pane.

## Search results overlays

Use these keys when `Ctrl+F` opens provider search or YouTube/SoundCloud network
search and the results list is open:

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `↑` `↓` / `j` `k` / `Ctrl+N` `Ctrl+P` | Move cursor (single item) |
| `Ctrl+U` `Ctrl+D` | Scroll results by page |
| `Enter` | Play the selected track now |
| `a` | Append the selected track to the playlist |
| `q` | Queue the selected track to play next |
| `p` | (Spotify only) Save the selected track to a Spotify playlist |
| `Esc` `Backspace` | Back to the search input |

## Fuzzy search

Local search boxes use fuzzy matching. Query characters must appear in order but
do not need to be next to each other. Results are ranked by relevance, with the
best match first. For example, `skr` and `saku` both find a track named "Sakura".

This applies to:

- `/` playlist search
- `/` file browser filter
- `Ctrl+F` when the active provider is Local (your saved playlists)

Other `Ctrl+F` providers, including Spotify, Qobuz, Tidal, Navidrome, Lyrion,
Jellyfin, Emby, Plex, Audiobookshelf, Mixcloud, NetEase, and YouTube, send the
query to their search API. Their services control matching rules.

## General

| Key | Action |

| `q` | Quit |
